 ### Analysis

- The weight of a mouse and the size of the tumor are in positive correlation.
- Stesalyn and Propriva were used with 24 mice and all the rest were used with 25 mice.
- Only Infubinol had an outlier.
- Capomulin had a smaller variance in final tumor volume in relation to the other three drugs.
- Ceftamin had a larger variance in final tumor volume in relation to the other three drugs.
- Female and male test subjects were almost equally distributed.
- Capomulin has the maximum mice number (230), and Zoniferol has the smaller (182).
- After removing duplicates the total number of mice is 248. Mice by gender show 124 female mice and 125 male mice.-
- The R-squared value of the regression analysis between average tumor volume and weight of mice is 0.70.
- The treatments that show the most reduction of tumor size are Capomulin and Ramicane.
